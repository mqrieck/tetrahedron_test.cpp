Glaring typo: Should be alpha < beta + gamma.

This assertion about q is wrong. It does change. I was sloppy about that.

I meant "the quantity q". That's the one that seems a bit "ad hoc" at the moment. Also, despite what I said, I do have a geometric interpretation for it.

Here we have an annoying but unimportant inconsistency with the code. The code actually fixes c3, and plots pairs (c1, c2).

So, in line with the previous comment, here I should be speaking of (c1,c2) pairs, not (c2,c3) pairs.

Here I finally confess my sin!

I meant "this surface," not "this curve."

(These were notes attaced to the Panopto video, but they seem to have disappeared.)
