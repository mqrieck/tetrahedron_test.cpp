# tetrahedron_test.cpp
Test code for my tetrahedron and toroid paper

The programs tetrahedon_test.cpp and dynamic_test_tetrahedron.cpp test my claims made in a (yet-to-be-published) research paper 
dealing with the construction of a tetrahedron based on a given acute triangle ABC (as a face). The possible interior angles 
(alpha, beta, gamma) at the new vertex P are restricted in various ways, by a system of inequalities. See the "notes" at the 
top of each source code file, as well as the displayed instructions, for further information. 

After compiling either program, one can either execute it without command-line parameters, to indicate that ABC should be an 
equilateral triangle, or else by specifying three integer parameters that indicate the ratios of the interior angles of the 
triangle ABC. 

Some animated GIFs are also provided here. These show examples of executing dynamic_tetrahedon.cpp.
